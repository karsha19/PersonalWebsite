        <p>
            Recently, I have been thinking about how our lives have evolved with technology.
            Our forefathers were probably impacted by the invention of transistors back in the mid-20th century. For
            people of <em>my generation</em>, yes, those born in the 80s, we lived through the times of cool retro video
            games, Macs, Ataris and then in the 90s, we witnessed the birth of the <em>internet</em>. Thank you, Uncle
            Tim and team :). From its simple use of web surfing and emailing, it has transformed and pervaded into our
            lives in every possible way. Unless we are an isolated tribe, almost everyone uses it (think web apps and
            Netflix) daily.
        </p>

        <p>
            Today, we see and hear the words <i>Artificial Intelligence </i> (AI) daily. Although AI was theorised and
            developed decades ago, the massive
            power of computing together with huge amounts of data available has enabled AI to thrive. We read countless
            op-eds on it every day as it is going to be the next wave which transforms our lives. As with
            every wave, the AI wave has generated debates and concerns on how it will affect society, such as how jobs
            will be transformed or replaced entirely, like the Industrial Revolution. So, being the efficient :)
            blogger, I was curious to know how capable ChatGPT was in generating blog content. Here's what it wrote on
            AI and its impact on society. Minor edits were made for a more personalised context.

                        <em>Transforming Industries:</em><br>
                        AI is reshaping various industries, including healthcare, finance, transportation, and more. In
                        healthcare, AI-powered diagnostic systems can assist doctors in accurate disease detection and
                        treatment
                        planning. In finance, AI algorithms can analyze market trends, automate trading, and enhance
                        risk
                        management. The transportation sector is witnessing advancements in autonomous vehicles,
                        revolutionizing
                        the way we travel. <span style="color:blue">For one, generative AI like ChatGPT is able to code
                            very well.
                            They could be a huge asset or be a detriment to software engineers. </span> These
                        transformations have the potential to improve services, reduce costs,
                        and
                        create new job opportunities.

                    <li>
                        <em>AI and the Workforce:</em><br>
                        The integration of AI into the workforce raises questions about the future of jobs. While AI
                        automation
                        may replace certain repetitive and mundane tasks, it also has the potential to create new job
                        roles.
                        As
                        AI systems become prevalent, there will be a growing need for professionals who can develop,
                        maintain,

                        <em>Ethical Considerations:</em><br>
                        The ethical implications of AI development cannot be overlooked. AI algorithms are only as good
                        as
                        the
                        data they are trained on, and biased or discriminatory data can perpetuate inequalities and
                        biases.<span style="color:blue">For example, there have been reports of employers who had
                            unknowingly used AI screening tools that rejected people of certain groups. It happened due
                            to the available training data which leaned towards other dominant groups. </span>
                        Ensuring fairness, transparency, and accountability in AI systems is crucial to prevent
                        unintended
                        consequences. Ethical frameworks, regulatory measures, and interdisciplinary collaborations are
                        essential for guiding AI development and mitigating potential risks.

                        <em>Privacy and Data Security:</em><br>
                        AI's reliance on vast amounts of data raises concerns about privacy and data security. AI
                        algorithms
                        often process personal and sensitive information, necessitating robust data protection measures.
                        Striking a balance between data-driven innovation and preserving individual privacy rights
                        requires
                        comprehensive data governance frameworks, encryption techniques, and user consent mechanisms.

                        <em>Socioeconomic Impact:</em><br>
                        The widespread adoption of AI may lead to socioeconomic disparities. Access to AI technologies,
                        digital
                        infrastructure, and AI education can contribute to a digital divide. Ensuring equitable
                        distribution
                        and
                        accessibility of AI benefits across different communities is essential to prevent exacerbating
                        existing
                        inequalities. Public-private collaborations and government initiatives are crucial to address
                        these
                        disparities and promote inclusive AI adoption. <span style="color:blue">Singapore, through its
                            National AI Strategy announced in 2019, outlined five initial National AI projects which
                            would create impactful AI solutions for society. One of the projects is in education. In the
                            few years since its launch, the Ministry of Education, Singapore, has piloted and launched
                            various AI projects, such as the Adaptive Learning System (ALS) and Language Feedback
                            Assistant. The ALS, deployed through the MOE's official learning platform called Student
                            Learning Space(SLS), uses machine learning to provide differentiated instructional materials
                            to cater to students of various abilities. Still a few years before it is fully launched,
                            its potential, if fully realised, provides a form of levelling in education. This is
                            important as there have been concerns that students with access to greater resources (eg.
                            tuition) would perform better with all things being equal. </span>

                    <li>
                        <em>Human-AI Collaboration:</em><br>
                        The future lies in fostering collaboration between humans and AI systems. ( like writing this
                        article &#128512; ) By leveraging the
                        unique
                        capabilities of AI, humans can focus on creativity, critical thinking, and complex
                        problem-solving.
                        AI
                        can augment human capabilities, assist decision-making, and provide valuable insights. Striking
                        the
                        right balance between human judgment and AI assistance will be key to maximizing the potential
                        of
                        both.

                <em>Conclusion:</em><br>
                Artificial Intelligence is poised to reshape society in profound ways. As we embrace the potential
                benefits
                of AI, we must also address the ethical, privacy, and socioeconomic considerations associated with its
                development and deployment. By fostering responsible AI practices, promoting inclusivity, and

        <p>
            Here's the version of my conclusion. To be honest, my opinions are also probably shaped by what has been
            read and
            observed. For one, we can't turn back time. Rather than be fearful of it, we can learn to embrace it.
            Exciting times lie ahead ...&#x1F30F;
