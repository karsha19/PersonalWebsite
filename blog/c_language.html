        <p>
            I first encountered the C programming language during my undergraduate days as part of my introductory
            course to computer science. Back then, it was a challenge for me as programming was new to me, with no prior
            knowledge whatsoever. Address, pointers and memory allocations were enough to throw me off programming,
            wondering if I will ever make it in programming. I recently revisited C in order to build more breadth in my
            programming skills. I have been using Java in my new role and I thought that it would be nice to supplement
            my skills with some C/C++ knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
            C was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie. It is an imperative procedural language with uses in operating
            systems and device drivers. C does not have object-orientation and garbage collection. Many languages have
            been built on the ideas of C, such as C++ and Java. Thus C's syntax is strikingly
            similar to Java.
        </p>
        <p>
            Coming back to my revisiting of the C programming language, I dived straight into the topics of pointers,
            address and memory management as these are not taught in Java. Java handles pointers, addresses, and memory
            management under the hood by abstracting these details from the programmer, providing a safer and more
            managed environment. Nonetheless, having knowledge of these topics would enable us to develop a greater
            appreciation at how computers manage memory and data. In some cases, there are some performance-critical
            applications which require fine-grained control of memory, which can be achieved with C. Let's discuss
            pointers, addresses and memory management briefly. Pointers and addresses
            will be discussed together since their usage in C language are closely related to each other. Memory
            management will have its own topic coverage below.
        </p>
        <p>
            <u>Pointers and Address</u>
        </p>
        <p>
            Pointers are variables that store the memory address of another variable. There are a few ways to declare a
            pointer.

        <div class="container">
            <pre class="preStyle">

        a) int* p;
        b) int *p;
        c) int * p;
    </pre>
        </div>

        </p>

        <p>
            All 3 approaches will work fine and it depends on individual preference on which approach to use.
            Personally, I prefer approach a). Visually, it tells me that p is a pointer which points at a memory that
            stores an integer. However, it might be a source of confusion when it is declared like this;

        <div class="container">
            <pre class="preStyle">

        int* p, q;
        </pre>
        </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            In the above example, although p is a pointer variable which stores an integer, q is not. It is an integer
            variable. For this reason, some prefer the style below to avoid confusion when declaring multiple variables
            in the same statement.
        <div class="container">
            <pre class="preStyle">

        int *p, q;
            </pre>
        </div>
        <p>
            Next, let's assign an address to a pointer. Recall that a pointer is a variable that store the memory
            address of another variable. Here, pointer b points to/stores the memory address of integer c which is
            assigned a
            value of 3. Note that the memory address is not the same as the integer value.
        <div class="container">
            <pre class="preStyle">

        int* b, c;
        c = 3;
        b = &c;
                </pre>
        </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            Below shows how the addresses of int c and pointer b are obtained. The address operator, '&' is used to
            obtain the address value of int c. Notice that the address operator is not used to retrieve the address
            value of pointer b as b already stores the address value.
        <div class="container">
            <pre class="preStyle">

        printf("Address of c: %p\n", &c);
        printf("Address of pointer b: %p\n", b);
                    </pre>
        </div>
        </p>
        <p>To retrieve the value pointed by b, we use the dereferencing operator, *, as shown below.
        <div class="container">
            <pre class="preStyle">

        printf("Address of c: %p\n", &c);
        printf("Address of pointer b: %p\n", b);
                        </pre>
        </div>

        </p>
