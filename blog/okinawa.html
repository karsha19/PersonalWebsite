            </p>


            <p>
                Sunny weather, beautiful oceans, and a rich history and cultureâ€”all of these can be found on the
                stunning island of Okinawa. I recently visited Okinawa in mid-July for a five-day getaway before
                starting my new work assignment. There wasn't any particular reason why I chose Okinawa; the flight
                wouldn't take too long, it wouldn't take too many days to explore the island, and of course,
                because I had never been there. This decision proved to be a wise one, as I enjoyed myself tremendously.
                Although my wife couldn't join me due to work commitments, I unexpectedly met a couple of friends who
                were also in Okinawa for a getaway. We ended up enjoying food, coffee, and some shopping together,
                turning this trip into a delightful mix of both group and solo experiences.
            </p>


            <p>
                Okinawa has a distinct culture and identity separate from the rest of Japan. This is because it was once
                an independent nation known as the Ryukyu Kingdom until it was annexed by Japan in 1879. The Ryukyu
                Kingdom was ruled as a tributary state of imperial Ming China by the Ryukyuan monarchy (Wikipedia,
                2024). This Chinese influence is evident in its culture, as I observed during my travels. Just look at
                the image below ðŸ˜Š.
            </p>

                    <div class="col-lg-12">
                        <figure style="text-align: center;">
                            <img src="../Images/okinawa/shurigate.webp" alt="shuri_gate" width="700" height="auto">

            </div></br>

            <p>
                We will also notice that it does not have some typical identities associated with mainland Japan such as
                Japanese castles, Japan Railway (JR) and presence of the big 3 Japanese banks in its midst. Instead,
                Okinawa has Shuri castle, gusukus, Yui monorail in Naha city and Bank of Okinawa.
            </p>
            <p>In this blog, I will share 3 features which make Okinawa unique, making this trip
                fun and memorable.</p>
            <p>1) Beaches and coast</p>

            <div class="container">

                                style="max-width: 100%; display: block;">

                    </div>
                    <div class="col-lg-4">

                    </div>

                    <div class="col-lg-4">
                        <figure style="text-align: center;">
                            <img src="../Images/okinawa/emerald3.webp" alt="emerald beach"

                    </div>
                </div>
            </div><br>

            <p>Okinawa's beaches are beautiful. The sky and ocean are clear dark blue in colour while it is turquoise
                nearer to the coast. This is due to the fact that the coast slopes gently to the ocean, allowing corals
                to be formed on shallow waters. During summer, people throng these beaches to have fun and cool off from
                the simmering summer heat.</p>

                </div>
            </div></br>
            <p>The Ryukyuan culture, which is deeply ingrained in Okinawan life, reflects a blend of influences,
                particularly from Chinese culture. This is evident in the design of castle gates and shrines, showcasing
                the architectural styles and artistic elements borrowed from China. The simplicity of Okinawan cuisine
                also stands out, with dishes featuring a combination of meat, tofu, and vegetables.

                One of the most iconic Okinawan dishes is goya champuru, a stir-fried dish made with bitter gourd, egg,
                and thinly sliced pork. This dish, celebrated for its unique bitterness and nutritional value,
                exemplifies the straightforward yet flavorful cooking style of the region. The dish
                is not seen in the above image as it came slightly later to our table. :)</p>

            <p>I recorded a video of a traditional Eisa folk dance performed by children on Kokusai-dori, Naha's main
                shopping street. Despite the scorching Sunday afternoon, these kids, who seemed barely 10 years
                old, showcased their cultural heritage with remarkable energy.</p>

            <p>3) Battle of Okinawa</p>
            <p>One lesser-known fact about Okinawa is that it was the site of one of the bloodiest battles in the
                Pacific during World War II. The Allied Forces, led by the Americans, invaded Okinawa with the intention
                of
                using it as a base to launch attacks on mainland Japan. The battle saw relentless artillery
                bombardments, naval gunfire, aerial assaults, and ground combat, resulting in massive destruction and
                the deaths of hundreds of thousands of soldiers and civilians, earning it the moniker, "Typhoon of
                Steel". During my visit, I explored three significant sites of
                the Battle of Okinawa: the Former Japanese Navy Underground Headquarters, Maeda Escarpment (Hacksaw
                Ridge), and Okinawa Peace Memorial Park.</p>

            <p>The Maeda Escarpment was another site of intense conflict during the Battle of Okinawa. This strategic
                location was fiercely defended by the Japanese army because its loss would grant the invading forces
                access to Shuri and Naha, the capital of Okinawa. As a result, a brutal battle ensued, resulting in the
                deaths of thousands of soldiers. The battle at Maeda Escarpment was depicted in the Hollywood movie
                "Hacksaw Ridge," starring former Spidey, Andrew Garfield.</p>

            <p>As US forces continued their push southward, the Japanese army was driven to its final stronghold at
                Mabuni Hill, now the site of the Okinawa Peace Memorial Park. Geographically, Mabuni Hill faces the
                Pacific Ocean. Realising their defeat, many Japanese officers and soldiers took their own lives there.
                The memorial park includes a museum that provides a detailed account of the Battle of Okinawa. For
                anyone interested in World War II in the Pacific, the Okinawa Peace Memorial Park is a must-visit.</p>

            <p>The American forces returned Okinawa to Japan in 1972. However, many US military bases remain, primarily
                located in the central part of the island. This American influence is evident in various aspects of
                Okinawan life, including certain local dishes, the presence of A&W fast-food franchises, and more. ðŸ˜Š

            <p>In my opinion, Okinawa offers an abundance of experiences for visitors. Amidst the bustle of Kokusai-dori
                and the sunny beaches, a rich story lies waiting to be discovered. Much of the land is rural, dotted
                with farmlands growing sugar cane. Describing Okinawa in a blog entry doesnâ€™t do it justiceâ€”you truly
                need to see it for yourself to appreciate all it has to offer.</p>

            <p>
                I decided to share more about Okinawa's World War II history as it dawned on me that much of what we
                experience today results from the post-war New World Order. Most soldiers who fought in the war are no
                longer with us, as it has been almost 80 years since its end. This sentiment was echoed by the President
                of the United States during the recent Normandy commemoration. We have peace, progress, and prosperity
                today because of the heroes who fought in the war. We cannot take them for granted and effort is needed
                to preserve peace. Let there be no more war.
