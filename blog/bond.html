        <p>
            I recently got the chance to watch the latest James Bond film, No Time to Die. It was after the completion
            of my final software engineering assessment. The show stars Daniel Craig in his final portrayal as 007 (You
            will find out why this is so at the end).
        </p>

        <p>
            I started following the James Bond franchise of movies since I was a kid. Back then, the MI6 Double-0 agent
            was portrayed by the likes of Sean Connery, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan. I think there
            are more actors but these are all I can remember. I am not a James Bond movie buff, just a casual viewer of
            the movie franchise when there is a chance to watch them.

        </p>

                <div class="col-md-12">
                    <figure style="text-align: center;">
                        <img src="../Images/bond2.jpeg" alt="astonmartin" width="420" height="315">

                </div>

                Well, I guess I was attracted to the workings of British intelligence, such as the Double-0 programme,
                where its agents are sanctioned to kill anyone who poses a threat to Great Britain and the world order,
                thus giving rise to the famous phrase ‘License to Kill’. The franchise inherits the Cold War-style of
                how spy agencies operate, such as having cool high-tech gadgetries, classic but technologically-advanced
                cars and codenames for senior MI6 operatives (who can forget Q and M?)
            </p>

            <p>
                I will not be revealing the storyline here as you can read it online elsewhere. In fact, you should
                watch the movie if you haven’t done so. Interestingly, the villain in this movie is not Blofeld. Instead
                he seeks revenge against Blofeld and the Spectre organisation as his family had been assassinated by
                them. Our British superspy also discovers that he has a daughter from his relationship with Madeleine
                Swann. The show ended predictably with James Bond defeating the villain, Safin, but sadly with Bond
                meeting his own end as well as Safin had infected Bond with the non-curable nano-virus during their
                scuffle.
            </p></br>

            <p>
                The show marks Daniel Craig’s exit from the franchise, paving the way for a possible reboot. It marks
                the end of a Bond-era which had awed a generation of audience since 2006. Reflecting on this, as I enter
                middle-age, many of the people I grew up with or know have also aged. Andy Lau is already 61, Shah Rukh
                Khan is 57 and Takuya Kimura is 50! The passage of time will never stop and this is an inescapable truth
                of life. While we are still around in this beautiful planet, how can we play our parts to create meaning
                in the world, to create more meaningful relationship and leave the world a better place than when we
                first entered it? Opportunities abound for us to effect them and it is up to us to discover them. Life
                is indeed beautiful.
