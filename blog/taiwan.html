            <p>
                Taiwan, an island nation off the southeastern coast of China, is a land of beauty and harmony, where
                culture blends seamlessly with advanced technologies that have come to define the island. This recent
                journey marked my second visit to Taiwan, the first being about ten years ago with my aunt. This time,
                my wife and I explored the cities of Taichung, Chiayi, and Kaohsiung, using Taipei as our base. The trip
                also
                offered an opportunity to visit my uncle and his family, who has lived in Taiwan for over 30 years. In
                addition, it was a special occasion as my uncle's son, (aka cousin) is about to get married.
            </p>


            <p>
                Officially known as the Republic of China (ROC), Taiwan's history is rich and complex, reflecting a
                blend of heritage and Chinese migration. Originally inhabited by the
                Ketagalan tribe and other indigenous groups, the island saw an influx of Han Chinese settlers during the
                Qing dynasty, who eventually became the predominant ethnic group. Taiwan's modern history
                took a significant turn during the Chinese Civil War. After losing control of mainland China to the
                Chinese Communist Party (CCP), the nationalist government, led by the Kuomintang (KMT), retreated to
                Taiwan. After some time, most countries switched their diplomatic recognition to the People's Republic
                of China (PRC), which is governed by the CCP. For most of the 20th century, Taiwan was led by the KMT,
                before open elections led
                to a truly
                democratic society. Today, Taiwan is led by a President from another party. Alright, enough of history.
                You can find out more about its history online, such as from Wikipedia.

            <p>
                We settled our breakfast daily mainly by eating at the coffee shops. One of the standard breakfast item
                in the menu is the dan ping (蛋餅). It is an egg crepe which looks and tastes just like roti prata. One
                can order dan ping with different types of filling such as ham or chicken meat. They also serve various
                types of sandwiches and burgers. Many locals would get them on the go while heading to work. Tea is
                definitely Taiwan's national beverage. I particularly enjoyed their oolong and Tie Guan Yin milk teas,
                where I could actually taste the rich flavors and aromatic fragrance of the teas.

            <p>The Taiwanese metro is just like the Singapore MRT. So, it was not difficult to move around
                in Taipei city. To travel to the different cities, we used the High Speed Rail (HSR). It was very
                convenient and comfortable, with cushioned seats and trains departing multiple times almost every hour.
                Travelling from Taipei in the north to the southern city of Kaoshiung takes only about 1.5 hours using
                the Express HSR train. One can consider staying overnight in the other cities to explore the attractions
                in
                a more relaxing pace.</p>

                It is not hard to identify that Taiwan has two national sports, basketball and
                baseball. It is quite common to see basketball complexes with at least five courts lined up next to each
                other. Baseball has a presence in every city we went to, as we walked past baseball stadiums and
                posters of baseball players. The picture below displays a giant baseball with the word "Kano",
                representing the baseball team in Chiayi city. A movie with the same name was made in 2014. It is
                based on a true story depicting the multiracial Kano baseball team from Japanese-era Taiwan.

                Interestingly, every city has a Confucius temple. Save for Taipei, we encountered Confucius temples of
                different scale and magnificence in each city. Perhaps, the prevalence of these temples symbolises the
                island's respect for
                Confucianism and its values.

            <p>
                The people are generally polite and helpful. Service staff across all levels, including those at
                immigration, hotels, eateries, and public transport, are friendly, professional, and eager to assist. A
                heartwarming example of this hospitality occurred at Taichung Park. While we were there, an elderly man
                kindly offered us his remaining bread to feed the koi fish in the pond. This simple yet generous gesture
                perfectly encapsulates the warmth and friendliness of the Taiwanese people.

                Taiwan is a land where the past and present coexist beautifully, offering a rich cultural and historical
                experience. Reconnecting with Taiwan after a decade has deepened my appreciation for this extraordinary
                place. The spirit, energy and solidarity of its people would certainly ensure that Taiwan would continue
                to
                have a bright future ahead.
