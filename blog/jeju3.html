                Our 6th day in Jeju was spent walking along the coastal areas of Seogwipo city. It had bays, cliffs and
                waterfalls which lined the coast, making it another area of attraction for nature lovers. We visited the
                areas seen in the map above. Our first stop was at Sojeongbang waterfall, which is not seen in the map.
                It's just slightly to the right of Jeongbang waterfall. It is a small waterfall of about 5 metres high
                located at a secluded corner of the coastal trail. We didn't encounter any visitors at Sojeongbang
                aside from the locals who were hiking the trail. The trail was beautifully paved and lined with trees,
                which made the walk enjoyable.

            <p>
                After a 15-minute walk, we reached the second waterfall, Jeongbang waterfall. The waterfall is higher
                than Sojeongbang at 23 metres. There were large rocks surrounding the waterfall below which we could
                stand on to capture beautiful photographs.

                After visiting Jeongbang, we had lunch at the nearby Chilsimni food street. We settled for standard
                Korean fare instead of the seafood which it is famous for. After lunch, we walked along Jaguri Park to
                our next destination, Cheonjiyeon. Jaguri Park had beautiful boardwalks and vast green fields, which
                made our stroll very enjoyable.

            <p>
                Before reaching Cheonjiyeon waterfall, we realised that there were two other attractions nearby, the
                Saeyeongyo Bridge and Saeseom Island, which the bridge leads to. Saeyeongyo Bridge had a column design
                which looked like a sail. There were strong winds when we walked up the bridge, such that it seemed like
                we could be blown away by it any minute. It created a howling sound that frightened us to some extent.
                After braving the strong winds and howling sound for a minute, we reached Saeseom Island.

            <p>Saeseom Island was a small island which has a nice trail along its coast. The breeze and picket fences
                which have become
                ubiquitous along Jeju's coasts made the walk extremely enjoyable and refreshing. As the trip to Saeseom
                Island was a detour, we picked up our pace and were back at Saeyongyo bridge in fifteen minutes.</p>

            <p>Cheonjiyeon waterfall is an inland waterfall known for its diverse plant and animal life (Wikipedia).
                Near the visitor booth, there were mandarin ducks at the river. Crowds of people gathered to take
                photographs of the birds,presumably because they were a rare sight. We walked inland for 15 minutes
                before reaching the Cheonjiyeon waterfall. After having seen a few waterfalls on the same day, it seemed
                just like another waterfall. Nonetheless, I guess each place has its own heritage and uniqueness. </p>

                After our visit to Cheonjiyeon Waterfall, it was already 5 pm. With the sun having set, we strolled
                through Seogwipo's bustling commercial district and enjoyed dinner at BHC, a renowned Korean fried
                chicken chain. This marked the end of our sixth day in Jeju.</p>

            <p>Day 7</p>


            <p>
                It is considered our final day in Jeju as we are flying back to Singapore tomorrow afternoon. We were
                slightly worn out from our marathon travels the past few days. In addition, I realised we had not really
                gotten to know the town area in Jeju city. So, we dedicated this day to our understanding Jeju's
                'people' heritage a bit more. </p>

            <p>We visited the Jeju Folklore and Natural History Museum. It was located at the Jeju old district. The
                skeleton of a dinosaur greeted us at the entrance. I couldn't whether it was a replica or real.</p>

            <p>The museum displays mainly natural historical items such as marine life, rocks, and fauna and flora of
                Jeju, giving visitors a better understanding of Jeju’s unique nature and culture. Many of the fauna and
                flora centred on those which inhabited Hallasan National Park. </p>

            <p>The folklore gallery on display showcased the daily lives of Jeju people over the cycle of the four
                seasons, and from birth to death. I noticed a striking similarity with the Chinese culture, such as
                the
                celebration of Lunar New Year. I also learnt something new on that day, and that is the Lunar New
                Year
                celebrates the end of winter and the start of spring. </p>
            <p>An intriguing gallery showcased the rich history of Jeju City, vividly narrating the evolution of
                both
                the old and new districts. It delved into the fascinating stories that shaped the unique character
                of
                Jeju, highlighting the seamless blend of tradition and modernity in the development of these
                districts.
            </p>
            <p>The final gallery which we visited was the maritime gallery. There were many interesting sea
                creatures
                which caught my attention. I guess it shouldn't be a surprise as Jeju is surrounded by the ocean.
                Again,
                I couldn't tell whether they were real or just replicas.</p>

            <p>After exiting the museum, we walked into a neighbourhood park called Shinsan park. There were many people
                at the park, many of whom were
                exercising. There was also a group of
                pre-schoolers having picnic with their teachers. There was a war memorial near to where the children
                were sitting down. It was built to honour soldiers who had fallen during the Korean War. </p>

            <p>After the educational trip to the museum and walk in the park, we ate lunch at a cafe near the park.
                After lunch, we walked along the roads and came across Jeju City Hall complex. We took a few photographs
                before continuing.
                Well, this is almost the end of our Jeju trip. We spent the rest of the time walking around in town and
                settled at Tom N Toms to have coffee. It was the first place that we visited on our first day, albeit a
                different outlet.

            <p>After our educational trip to the museum and a leisurely walk in the park, we decided to have lunch at a
                cafe located near the park. Following that, we walked along the roads and came across the Jeju City Hall
                complex. We took a few photographs before continuing our exploration.

                Well, this is almost the end of our Jeju trip. We spent the remaining time strolling around town,
                soaking in the
                local atmosphere. Our final stop was at Tom N Toms for coffee, a fitting end to our journey. It was the
                same cafe chain we visited on our first day, albeit a different outlet. This closed the curtain on our
                memorable trip in Jeju. Thank you for the restful week and cherished memories in this beautiful island.
